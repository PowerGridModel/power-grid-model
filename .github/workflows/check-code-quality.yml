# GitHub Action that uses
#     isort, black, mypy and pylint to reformat the Python code in an incoming pull request.
#     clang-format to reformat the C++ code in an incoming pull request.
# If all code in the pull request is compliant with Black and clang-format then this Action
# does nothing. Otherwise, it will print the files which need to be reformatted and raise an error.
