# Build Guide

This document explains how you can build this library from source, including some examples of build environment. In this
repository there are three builds:

* A `power-grid-model` [pip](https://pypi.org/project/power-grid-model/) Python package with C++ extension as the calculation core.
* A [CMake](https://cmake.org/) project consisting of the C++ header-only calculation core, and the following build targets:
    * A dynamic library (`.dll` or `.so`) with stable pure C API/ABI which can be used by any application
    * Native C++ unit tests
    * C API tests
    * A performance benchmark program
    * An example C program to call the shared library
    * An install target that installs a package that contains the dynamic library
* A separate example [CMake](https://cmake.org/) project with a small C++ program that shows how to find and use the installable
  package.

## Build Requirements

To build the library from source, you need to first prepare the compiler toolchains and the build dependencies. In this
section a list of general requirements are given. After this section there are examples of setup in Linux (Ubuntu 22.04),
Windows 10, and macOS (Big Sur).

### Architecture Support

This library is written and tested on `x86_64` and `arm64` architecture. Building the library in `IA-32` might be working, but is
not tested.

The source code is written with the mindset of ISO standard C++ only, i.e. avoid compiler-extension or platform-specific
features as much as possible. In this way the effort to port the library to other platform/architecture might be
minimum.

### Compiler Support

You need a C++ compiler with C++20 support. Below is a list of tested compilers:

**Linux**

* gcc >= 11.0
  * Version 12.x tested using the version in the `manylinux_2_28` container.
  * Version 12.x tested using the musllinux build with custom compiler
  * Version 11.x tested in CI
* Clang >= 14.0
  * Version 14.x tested in CI
  * Version 15.x tested in CI with code quality checks

You can define the environment variable `CXX` to for example `clang++` to specify the C++ compiler.

**Windows**

* MSVC >= 17.5
  * Latest release tested in CI (e.g. Visual Studio 2022, IDE or build tools)
* Clang CL >= 14.0
  * Latest release tested in CI (e.g. Visual Studio 2022, IDE or build tools)

**macOS**

* Clang >= 14.0
  * Latest release tested in CI

### Build System for CMake Project

This repository uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.23 or later) and [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) as C++ build system.

## Build Python Package

Once you have prepared the build dependencies, 
you can install the library from source in develop mode with the development dependency. 
Go to the root folder of the repository.

```
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Then you can run the tests.

```
pytest
```

## Build CMake Project

There is a root cmake file in the root folder of the repo `CMakeLists.txt`. It specifies
dependencies and the build options for the project. The core algorithm is implemented in the header-only
library `power_grid_model`. There are four sub-projects defined in the root cmake file:

* `power_grid_model_c`: a dynamic library (`.dll` or `.so`) with stable pure C API/ABI which can be used by any application
* `tests/cpp_unit_tests`: the unit test target for the C++ core using the `doctest` framework.
* `tests/c_api_tests`: the C API test target using the `doctest` framework
* `tests/cpp_validation_tests`: the validation test target using the `doctest` framework
* `tests/benchmark_cpp`: the C++ benchmark target for performance measure.
* `power_grid_model_c_example`: an example C program to call the dynamic library

In principle, you can use any C++ IDE with cmake and ninja support to develop the C++ project. It is also possible to use
the bare CMake CLI to set up the project. For ease of use, several presets are available (CMake 3.23+). Supported presets
for your development platform can be listed using `cmake --list-presets`.

## Visual Studio Code Support

You can use any IDE to develop this project. As a popular cross-platform IDE, the settings for Visual Studio Code is preconfigured in the folder `.vscode`. You can open the repository folder with VSCode and the configuration will be loaded automatically. 

```{note}
VSCode (as well as some other IDEs) does not set its own build environment itself. For optimal usage, open the folder
using `cmake <project_dir>` from a terminal that has the environment set up. E.g.:

* For x64 Windows native development using MSVC or Clang CL, use the `x64 Native Command Prompt`, which uses
  `vcvarsall.bat` to set the appropriate build environment.
* For Linux/WSL using the LLVM-14 `clang`, `source` or `export` `CC=clang-14`, `CXX=clang++-14` and `LLVM_COV=llvm-cov-14`. Optionally, you can `export` `CLANG_TIDY=clang-tidy-14`.
```

## Build Script for Linux/macOS

There is a convenient shell script to build the cmake project in Linux or macOS:
{{ "[`build.sh`]({}/build.sh)".format(gh_link_head_blob) }}. You can study the file and write your own build script.
The following options are supported in the build script.

```shell
Usage: ./build.sh -p <preset> [-c] [-e] [-i] [-t]
  -c option generates coverage if available
  -e option to run C API example
  -i option to install package
  -t option to run integration test (requires '-i')
```

To list the available presets, run `./build.sh -h`.

## Example Setup for Ubuntu 22.04 (in WSL or physical/virtual machine)

In this section an example is given for setup in Ubuntu 22.04. You can use this example in Windows Subsystem for Linux (
WSL), or in a physical/virtual machine.

### Environment variables

Append the following lines into the file `${HOME}/.bashrc`.

```shell
export CXX=clang++-14            # or g++-11
export CC=clang-14               # gcc-11
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
export LLVM_COV=llvm-cov-14
export CLANG_TIDY=clang-tidy-14  # only if you want to use one of the clang-tidy presets
```

### Ubuntu Software Packages

Install the following packages from Ubuntu.

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install -y wget curl zip unzip tar git build-essential gcovr lcov gcc g++ clang make gdb ninja-build pkg-config python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-venv python3-pip
```

### C++ packages

The recommended way to get C++ package is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 
Go to its website to follow the installation instruction.

Install the C++ dependencies

```shell
brew install boost eigen nlohmann-json msgpack-cxx doctest cmake
```

### Build Python Library from Source

It is recommended to create a virtual environment. 
Clone repository, create and activate virtual environment. 
Go to a root folder you prefer to save the repositories.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model.git
cd power-grid-model
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

Install from source in develop mode, and run `pytest`.

```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest
```

### Build CMake Project

There is a convenient shell script to build the cmake project: {{ "[`build.sh`]({}/build.sh)".format(gh_link_head_blob) }}.

As an example, go to the root folder of repo. Use the following command to build the project in release mode:

```shell
./build.sh -p <preset>
```

To list the available presets, run `./build.sh -h`.

One can run the unit tests and C API example by:

```shell
ctest --test-dir cpp_build/<preset>
```

or

```shell
cpp_build/<preset>/bin/power_grid_model_unit_tests

cpp_build/<preset>/bin/power_grid_model_c_example
```

or install using

```shell
cmake --build --preset <preset> --target install
```


## Example Setup for Windows 10

Define the following environment variable user-wide:

| Name                | Value                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` | `C:\conda_envs\cpp_pkgs\Library` |

### Software Toolchains

You need to install the MSVC compiler. You can either install the whole Visual Studio IDE or just the build tools.

* [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe) (free)
    * Select C++ build tools
* Full [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (All three versions are suitable. Check the license!)
    * Select Desktop Development with C++
        * [Optional] Select `C++ Clang tools for Windows`

Other toolchains:

* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), install Python 3 64-bit under user wide.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### C++ packages

The recommended way to get C++ package is via `conda`. Open a miniconda console.

```shell
conda create --yes -p C:\conda_envs\cpp_pkgs -c conda-forge boost-cpp eigen nlohmann_json msgpack-cxx doctest
```

### Build Python Library from Source

It is recommended to create a `conda` environment. 
Clone repository, create and activate `conda` environment. 
Go to a root folder you prefer to save the repositories, open a Git Bash Console.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model.git
```

Then open a Miniconda PowerShell Prompt, go to the repository folder.

```shell
conda create -n power-grid-env python=3.10
conda activate power-grid-env
```

Install from source in develop mode, and run `pytest`.

```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest
```
```{note}
Long paths for (dependencies in) the miniconda installation environment might exceed the `maximum path length limitation` set by Windows, causing the installation to fail.
It is possible to enable long paths in Windows by following the steps in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry)
```

### Build CMake Project

If you have installed Visual Studio 2019/2022 (not the build tools), you can open the repo folder as a cmake project.
The IDE should be able to automatically detect the Visual Studio cmake configuration file
`CMakePresets.json`. Several configurations are pre-defined. It includes debug and release builds.

* `msvc-debug`, displayed as `Debug (MSVC)`
* `msvc-release`, displayed as `Release (MSVC)`.
* `clang-cl-debug`, displayed as `Debug (Clang CL)`
* `clang-cl-release`, displayed as `Release (Clang CL)`

```{note}
- The `Release` presets are compiled with debug symbols.
- The `Clang CL` presets require `clang-cl` to be installed, e.g. by installing `C++ Clang tools for Windows`.
- When using an IDE that does not automatically set the toolchain environment using `vcvarsall.bat`, e.g. Visual
  Studio Code, make sure to open that IDE from a terminal that does so instead (e.g. `x64 Native Tools Command
  Prompt`).
```

## Example Setup for macOS (Big Sur)

In this section an example is given for setup in macOS Big Sur and Python 3.10.

### Environment variables

Append the following lines into the file `${HOME}/.bashrc`.

```shell
export CXX=clang++
export CC=clang
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local
```

### macOS Software Packages and C++ libraries

Install the following packages with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```shell
brew install ninja cmake boost eigen nlohmann-json msgpack-cxx doctest
```

### Build Python Library from Source

It is recommended to create a virtual environment. Clone repository, create and activate virtual environment, and
install the build dependency. go to a root folder you prefer to save the repositories.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model.git 
cd power-grid-model
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

Install from source in develop mode, and run `pytest`.

```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest
```

### Build CMake Project

There is a convenient shell script to build the cmake project: {{ "[`build.sh`]({}/build.sh)".format(gh_link_head_blob) }}.

**Note: the test coverage option is not supported in macOS.**

As an example, go to the root folder of repo. Use the following command to build the project in release mode:

```shell
./build.sh -p <preset>
```

To list the available presets, run `./build.sh -h`.

One can run the unit tests and C API example by:

```shell
ctest --test-dir cpp_build/<preset>
```

or

```shell
cpp_build/<preset>/bin/power_grid_model_unit_tests

cpp_build/<preset>/bin/power_grid_model_c_example
```

or install using

```shell
cmake --build --preset <preset> --target install
```

## Package tests

The {{ "[package tests]({}/tests/package_tests)".format(gh_link_head_blob) }} project is a completely separate CMake
project contained in {{ "[`tests/package_tests`]({}/tests/package_tests)".format(gh_link_head_blob) }}.

This project is designed to test and illustrate finding and linking to the installed package from the Power Grid Model
project. Setup of this project is done the same way as the setup of the main project mentioned in the above, but with
the {{ "[`tests/package_tests`]({}/tests/package_tests)".format(gh_link_head_blob) }} directory as its root folder.

```{note}
This project has the main project as a required dependency. Configuration will fail if the main project has not been
built and installed, e.g. using `cmake --build --preset <preset> --target install` for the current preset.
```
