# Graph Data Model

To represent the physical grid components, and the calculation results,
this library uses a graph data model.
In this document, the graph data model is presented with the list of all components types,
and their relevant input/output attributes.

# Enumerations

Some attributes of components are enumerations.
The enumerations are implemented using 8-bit signed integer, as explained in
[Native Data Interface](native-data-interface.md).

The table below for a list of enumerations.
They are all defined in the module `power_grid_model.enum`.
The underlying type of enumeration is `int8_t`.

| enum type name in Python | possible values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | usage |

# Component Type Hierarchy and Graph Data Model

The components types are organized in an inheritance-like hierarchy.
A sub-type has all the attributes from its parent type.
The hierarchy of the component types is shown below.

**NOTE: the type names in the hierarchy are exactly the same as the component type names
in the `power_grid_model.power_grid_meta_data`, see [Native Data Interface](native-data-interface.md)**

```

This library uses a graph data model with three generic component types: `node`, `branch`, and `appliance`.
A node is similar to a vertex in the graph, a branch is similar to an edge in the graph.
An appliance is a component which is connected (coupled) to a node, it is seen as a user of this node.
The figure below shows a simple example:

```
node_1 ---line_3 (branch)--- node_2
 |                             |
source_5 (appliance)       sym_load_4 (appliance)
```

There are two nodes (points/vertices) in the graph of this simple grid.
The two nodes are connected by `line_3` which is a branch (edge).
Furthermore, there are two appliances in the grid.
The `source_5` is coupled to `node_1` and the `sym_load_4` is coupled to `node_2`.

# Symmetry of Components and Calculation

It should be emphasized that the symmetry of components and calculation are two independent concepts in the model.
For example, a power grid model can consist of both `sym_load` and `asym_load`.
They are symmetric or asymmetric load components.
On the other hand, the same model can execute symmetric or asymmetric calculations.
* In case of symmetric calculation, the `asym_load` will be treated as a symmetric load
by averaging the specified power through three phases.
* In case of asymmetric calculation, the `sym_load` will be treated as an asymmetric load
by dividing the total specified power equally into three phases.

# Attributes of Components

The attributes of components are listed in the tables in the sections below.
The column names of the tables are as follows:

* name: name of the attribute.
  It is exactly the same as the attribute name in `power_grid_model.power_grid_meta_data`.
* data type: data type of the attribute.
  It is either a type from the table in [Native Data Interface](native-data-interface.md).
  Or it can be an enumeration as above defined. There is two special data types `RealValueInput` and `RealValueOutput`.
    * `RealValueInput` is used for some input attributes.
      It is a `double` for a symmetric class (e.g. `sym_load`) and `double[3]` an asymmetric class (e.g. `asym_load`).
      It is explained in detail in the corresponding types.
    * `RealValueOutput` is used for many output attributes.
      It is a `double` in symmetric calculation and `double[3]` for asymmetric calculation.
    * As noted above, these two special types are independent.
* unit: unit of the attribute, if it is applicable. As a general rule, only standard SI units without any prefix are used.
* description: description of the attribute.
* required: if the attribute is required. If not, then it is optional.
  Note if you choose not to specify an optional attribute,
  it should have the null value as defined in [Native Data Interface](native-data-interface.md).
* input: if the attribute is part of an input dataset.
* update: if the attribute can be mutated by the update call `PowerGridModel.update` on an existing instance,
  only applicable when this attribute is part of an input dataset.
* output: if the attribute is part of an output dataset.
* valid values: if applicable, an indication which values are valid for the input data

# Validation
For performance reasons, the input/update data is not automatically validated.
There are validation functions available in the `power_grid_model.validation` module:

```python
# Manual validation
#   validate_input_data() assumes that you won't be using update data in your calculation.
#   validate_batch_data() validates input_data in combination with batch/update data.
validate_input_data(input_data, calculation_type, symmetric) -> List[ValidationError]
validate_batch_data(input_data, update_data, calculation_type, symmetric) -> Dict[int, List[ValidationError]]

# Assertions
#   assert_valid_input_data() and assert_valid_batch_data() raise a ValidationException,
#   containing the list/dict of errors, when the data is invalid.
assert_valid_input_data(input_data, calculation_type, symmetric) raises ValidationException
assert_valid_batch_data(input_data, calculation_type, update_data, symmetric) raises ValidationException

# Utilities
#   errors_to_string() converts a set of errors to a human readable (multi-line) string representation
errors_to_string(errors, name, details)
```

Have a look at the Jupyter Notebook "[Validation Examples](../examples/Validation%20Examples.ipynb)" for more information 
on how to apply these functions.

# Component Types

## Base

* type name: `base`

The base type for all power grid components.

| name | data type | unit | description | required | input | update | output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `id` | `int32_t` | - | ID of a component, the id should be unique along all components, i.e. you cannot have a node with `id` 5 and a line with `id` 5. | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10060; (id needs to be specified in the update query, but cannot be changed) | &#10004; |
| `energized` | `int8_t` | - | Indicates if a component is energized, i.e. connected to a source | &#10004; | &#10060; | &#10060; | &#10004; |

## Node

* type name: `node`

`node` is a point in the grid. Physically a node can be a busbar, a joint, or other similar component.

| name | data type | unit | description | required | input | update | output | valid values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

## Branch

* type name: `branch`

`branch` is the abstract base type for the component which connects two *different* nodes.
For each branch two switches are always defined at from- and to-side of the branch.
In reality such switches may not exist.
For example, a cable usually permanently connects two joints.
In this case, the attribute `from_status` and `to_status` is always 1.

| name | data type | unit | description | required | input | update | output | valid values |

| `loading` | `double` | - | relative loading of the line, `1.0` meaning 100% loaded. | &#10004; | &#10060; | &#10060; | &#10004; | |


### Line

* type name: 'line'

`line` is a branch with specified serial impedance and shunt admittance. A cable is also modeled as `line`.
A `line` can only connect two nodes with the same rated voltage.

### Link

* type name: `link`

`link` usually represents a short internal cable/connection between two busbars inside a substation.
It has a very high admittance (small impedance) which is set to a fixed per-unit value
(equivalent to 10e6 siemens for 10kV network).
There is no additional attribute for `link`.

### Transformer

`transformer` connects two nodes with possibly different voltage levels.

**Note: three-winding transformer is not supported yet.**

**Note: it can happen that `tap_min > tap_max`.
In this case the winding voltage is decreased if the tap position is increased.**

## Appliance

* type name: `appliance`

`appliance` is an abstract user which is coupled to a `node`.
For each `appliance` a switch is defined between the `appliance` and the `node`.

**The sign of active/reactive power of the appliance depends on the reference direction.**

* For load reference direction, positive active power means the power flows *from the node to the appliance*.
* For generator reference direction, positive active power means the power flows *from the appliance to the node*.

### Source

* type name: `source`
* reference direction: generator

`source` is representing the external network with a
[Thévenin's equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9venin%27s_theorem).
It has an infinite voltage source with an internal impedance.
The impedance is specified by convention as short circuit power.

### Shunt

* type name: `shunt`
* reference direction: load

`shunt` is an `appliance` with a fixed admittance (impedance).
It behaves similar to a load/generator with type `const_impedance`.

## Sensor

* type name: `sensor`

`sensor` is an abstract type for all the sensor types.
A sensor does not have any physical meaning. Rather, it provides measurement data for the state estimation algorithm.
The state estimator uses the data to evaluate the state of the grid with the highest probability.

| name | data type | unit | description | required | input | update | output | valid values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `measured_object` | `int32_t` | - | id of the measured object | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10060; | &#10060; | a valid object id |

### Generic Voltage Sensor

* type name: `generic_voltage_sensor`

`generic_voltage_sensor` is an abstract class for symmetric and asymmetric voltage sensor.
It measures the magnitude and (optionally) the angle of the voltage of a `node`.

| name | data type | unit | description | required | input | update | output | valid values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `u_sigma` | `double` | volt (V) | standard deviation of the measurement error. Usually this is the absolute measurement error range divided by 3. | &#10024; only for state estimation | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10060; | `> 0` |


#### Voltage Sensor Concrete Types

There are two concrete types of voltage sensor. They share similar attributes:
the meaning of `RealValueInput` is different, as shown in the table below. In a `sym_voltage_sensor` the measured voltage is a line-to-line voltage.
In a `asym_voltage_sensor` the measured voltage is a 3-phase line-to-ground voltage.

| type name | meaning of `RealValueInput` |
| --- | --- |
| `sym_voltage_sensor` | `double` |
| `asym_voltage_sensor` | `double[3]` |

The table below shows a list of attributes.

| name | data type | unit | description | required | input | update | output | valid values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `u_measured` | `RealValueInput` | volt (V) | measured voltage magnitude | &#10024; only for state estimation | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10060; | `> 0` |

| `u_residual` | `RealValueOutput` | volt (V) | residual value between measured voltage magnitude and calculated voltage magnitude | &#10004; | &#10060; | &#10060; | &#10004; | |
| `u_angle_residual` | `RealValueOutput` | rad | residual value between measured voltage angle and calculated voltage angle (only possible with phasor measurement units) | &#10060; | &#10060; | &#10060; | &#10004; | |


### Generic Power Sensor

* type name: `generic_power_sensor`

`power_sensor` is an abstract class for symmetric and asymmetric power sensor.
It measures the active/reactive power flow of a terminal.
The terminal is either connecting an `appliance` and a `node`,
or connecting the from/to end of a `branch` and a `node`.
In case of a terminal between an `appliance` and a `node`,
the power reference direction in the measurement data is the same as the reference direction of the `appliance`.
For example, if a `power_sensor` is measuring a `source`,
a positive `p_measured` indicates that the active power flows from the source to the node.

| `power_sigma` | `double` | volt-ampere (VA) | standard deviation of the measurement error. Usually this is the absolute measurement error range divided by 3. | &#10024; only for state estimation| &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10060; | `> 0` |
