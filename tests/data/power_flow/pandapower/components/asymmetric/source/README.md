## Component Test Case: Source

Test case for validation of source component for asymmetrical power flow calculations in pandapower.
- While source is present in all cases, this case tests two sources being used together.

```

### Modelling incompatibility with pandapower

- Source impedance is set too low. Result of source component here should be ignored
